Good Lord, that's a LOT of chests.[AN]
This can't be real. There has to[N]
be a catch, there's always a catch.[AN]
It's never this easy. As soon as[N]
I open one of these, a trap is[AN]
going to be sprung, and I'm going[N]
to take an arrow to the chest,[AN]
or perhaps it's a mimic that[N]
will attempt to eat me. Or maybe[AN]
it's an alarm that will trigger a[N]
flood of bandits to come in and[AN]
capture me or kill me where I[N]
stand. That's how it always goes[AN]
in these scenarios with easy to[N]
access treasure.[A]
