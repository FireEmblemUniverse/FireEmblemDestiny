...A dragonstone?[N]
Oh, come on.[AN]
So not only is there[N]
a character who gets[AN]
to wield both swords[N]
and dragonstones,[AN]
but that character[N]
just so happens to be[AN]
the mysterious royal[N]
hero who everyone is[AN]
fawning all over?[AN]
So we've got no game[N]
balance AND no--[A]

[.....v]
The blood of the[N]
Virgin Dragon[AN]
courses through[N]
your veins, milord.[A] 

[...v..]
With this dragonstone[N]
you may freely tap[AN]
into the power of[N]
your birthright.[A]

[.v....]
Oh, and would you[N]
look at that. When[AN]
the mysterious hero[N]
gets his superweapon,[AN]
the entire building he's[N]
in just so happens to[AN]
completely vanish! You[N]
know, just in case you[AN]
didn't think he was[N]
almighty enough already.[AN]
Good job, IS. This is[N]
totally how video games[AN]
are meant to work![A]

[...v..]
With the power to channel[N]
and tame the Virgin Dragon's[AN]
wrath, milord, you are ready[N]
to grip your fate by the[AN]
hair and reshape this world.[A]

[.....v]
The path to peace is yours.[A]

[.v....]
Hang on. You all lived[N]
here, didn't you?[AN]
Where exactly are[N]
you going to go now?[AN]
You're not... going to[N]
try to pack yourselves[AN]
into this chest here,[N]
are you?[A]

[.....v]
Fret not, milord.[AN]
The true abode of the[N]
Sisters of the Virgin Dragon[AN]
awaits our return.[A]

[...v..]
We need only the[N]
shelter of a gentle[AN]
woodland stream, that[N]
we may frolic and bathe[AN]
before the creatures[N]
of the forest as the[AN]
Virgin Dragon intended.[A]

[.v....]
...Oh, for fuck's sake.[A]

[.....v]
Fare thee well, milord.[A]

[...v..]
Truly we wish we could[N]
give you due service[AN]
on your quest, but--[A]

[.v....]
No.[A] Bye.[A][X]
