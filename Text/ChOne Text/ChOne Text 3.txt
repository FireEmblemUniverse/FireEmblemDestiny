Hi! Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm Zim.[AN]
Are you here to exterminate[N]
the bandits as well?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Is that... a MAID uniform?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, that's right.[A][NL]
I'm a maid for Duke,[NL]
uh... [.6]uh...[.6][2NL]
I'm a maid.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveRight]
ARE YOU KIDDING ME??[A][NL]
Not to mention, maids. MAIDS!![NL]
Are you fucking shitting me?[A][NL]
Oh, we've got to kill bandits[NL]
for some reason. Who's the best[NL]
person to send to do it?[NL]
Household help, OF COURSE.[NL]
It's not like we don't have[NL]
enough blatant fanservice in[NL]
the form of a certain wyvern[NL]
rider for the idiot teens to[NL]
jack off too, no, we need[NL]
fucking maids. I've never seen[NL]
something so tasteless in my life.[NL]
This is almost as stupid as two[NL]
characters falling in love[NL]
over pie. Oh wait, THAT ACTUALLY[NL]
FUCKING HAPPENED. At least, we're[NL]
not sexist tho, because we have[NL]
butlers too. Seriously, was just[NL]
changing the trickster class to[NL]
use these new hidden weapons and[NL]
staves too hard, or were you that[NL]
desperate for MORE fanservice?[NL]
Oh wait, tricksters get bows and[NL]
staves now. Why? Why are thieves[NL]
wielding bows now? Why would a[NL]
THIEF carry a big ass bow around[NL]
when their trying to sneak around[NL]
to steal shit. You actually have[NL]
knives again now, why not have[NL]
the thieves use them? Back in[NL]
my day, when we had knives in[NL]
an FE game, thieves actually used[NL]
the knives. Sure, the knives were[NL]
damn near useless, but who actually[NL]
used them actually made fucking[NL]
sense. But nooooooo, you bring back[NL]
knives for what appears to be[NL]
no other reason than to justify[NL]
this blatant fanservice class[NL]
existing. I knew this series was[NL]
fucked when I saw the HP +5 skill,[NL]
but come on, at least TRY to[NL]
suggest that you are learning, IS.[NL]
At this rate, we'll get a[NL]
difficulty that removes all[NL]
challenge that reminds me of[NL]
a phoenix. Oh wait, that actually[NL]
happened? Shit.[.....][NL]
If we ever get something this[NL]
bad again, I fucking quit.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Uhm...[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Yeah. He does that a lot.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
But yes, bandits.[A]
[ClearFace]

[MidRight]
Yes, [MoveMidRight]bandits.[A]
[ClearFace]

[OpenFarRight]
Right, [MoveFarRight]bandits.[A]
[ClearFace]

[OpenRight]
What? But I don't[NL]
even want to --[.7][X]
