Hey Arch, I think[NL]
we've just found the[A][NL]
hideout of the bandits[NL]
we encountered earlier.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
What!? But I was just wandering.[NL]
What kind of plot convienience is this?[A][2NL][FastPrint]
I wasn't even looking for the hideout.[NL]
Is that all plots are nowadays? Mere[NL]
convieniences to move you from one[NL]
objective to the next? Man, I remember[NL]
when the plot used to tell a real,[NL]
meaningful story. What happened to[NL]
villains with motives other than[NL]
"lolevil"? What happened to the[NL]
descriptive journeys across the[NL]
continent? Instead, all we get[NL]
is a handful of forgettable locations[NL]
and you don't even know why these[NL]
places are important, or if they are[NL]
important at all. Hell, 90% of the[NL]
time location names are CONTRADICTORY[NL]
to past events. Why the hell is there[NL]
a shrine to Mila in the area of[NL]
Valencia that used to be RIGEL?[NL]
Why is the place the Japanese version[NL]
of FE13 refers to as Duma's Remains[NL]
NOWHERE NEAR close to where you[NL]
actually fought Duma in FE2?[NL]
If you're going to shoehorn in[NL]
random FE2 references cause[NL]
"Muh Fanservice" then at least[NL]
put them in the RIGHT FUCKING[NL]
LOCATIONS IS.[.....] Never mind the lack[NL]
of thought put into these supposed[NL]
"historical locations" in their map[NL]
design. Let's just put the map for[NL]
FE2's Ram Mountain on a random ass island[NL]
because why not. Rudolf may have been[NL]
an idiot with a stupid plan, but at least[NL]
he had ACTUAL FUCKING MOTIVATIONS,[NL]
unlike idiots like Validar and Garon.[NL]
God above, what the fuck happened[NL]
to this series?[A][NL]
[OpenFarLeft]
You do that a lot, don't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
That thing. That you[NL]
were just doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I mean when something so great becomes[NL]
SUCH a sellout, it's hard not to.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Suuuuure. Anyway, we're going[NL]
to take out the bandits.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
 . [......] . [......] . [......]WHAT?[.....][A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I mean, we're at their[NL]
hideout anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
But why? We don't even need to.[A][NL]
We could just... leave and[NL]
be on our merry way.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Well, they're bandits.[NL]
We can't just let them be.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
So what? You're just going to[NL]
risk your lives for no reason[A][NL]
and just slaughter them all?[A]
[OpenLeft]
Yep![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
I don't even...[A][OpenEyes][NL]
Well, I guess it's been[NL]
nice knowing you.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Aww, what are you saying Arch?[A][NL]
Of course you're coming[NL]
along with us![A]
[OpenMidRight]
I... am? [.....]Of cooourse I am,[NL]
guy wakes up in the middle of nowhere,[A][NL]
of course he has to be some kind of[NL]
bandit slayer, right? Not like he has[A][NL]
more important things, like finding[NL]
his way back or anything.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Great! We're in agreement then.[NL]
Let's go![A][NL]

Good Lord...[A][X]
