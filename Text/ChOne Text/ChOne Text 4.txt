Oh! Arch. I think[NL]
that's a Dragon Vein.[A]
[OpenRight]
Oh?[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
Yeah! I think you should[NL]
be able to use it.[A]
[OpenRight]
That doesn't even[N]
make any sense.[A][NL]
Why me? I thought I[NL]
was just supposed to be[A][NL]
some self-insert who --[.....][A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
Anyway, this one might be[NL]
able to weaken the bandits.[A][NL]
I think.[A]
[OpenRight]
How would you know?[A]
[OpenLeft]
Oh, I can just tell.[A]
[OpenRight]
...[.....] Of course.[A]
[OpenLeft]
I think I also see veins[NL]
for sealing off sections[A][NL]
of the hideout. You might[NL]
want to use those so[A][NL]
we don't get flanked by[NL]
the bandits.[A]

Sure, sure. Thank you for[NL]
your wise, sagely advice.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
Sure! Anytime.[A]
[OpenRight][OpenEyes]
... Ugh.[A]
