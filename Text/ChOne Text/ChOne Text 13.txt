There it is, milord.[AN]
In thine noble fray,[N]
thou smote the throne[AN]
in twain, revealing[N]
your birthright.[A]

[.v....]
I didn't touch the throne.[N]
Nobody touched the throne.[AN]
The throne is completely[N]
intact. Look, it's right[AN]
there in front of you.[A]

[.....v]
Aye, the throne is intact[N]
in the physical realm,[AN]
but in the spirital realm,[N]
thine pulsing divine aura[AN]
rent the throne, which now[N]
lies bent to receive the[AN]
will of its master.[A]

[...v..]
The Dragon Vein lies[N]
bare before you, milord.[AN]
You need only rouse it.[A]

[.v....]
Sigh. Look, put some proper[N]
clothes on and I'll do it,[AN]
alright?[A]

[.....v]
You ask the impossible,[N]
milord.[A]

[...v..]
The Virgin God wouldst be[N]
most sorrowful to know[AN]
our nubile flesh hast become[N]
profaned by common rags.[A]

[.v....]
...Ugh. Fine. Let's[N]
get this over with.[A][X]
