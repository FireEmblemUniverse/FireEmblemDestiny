Well, that's over. Now that[NL]
those bandits have been beaten,[A][NL]
maybe we can get to an[NL]
actually good game? I mean,[A][NL]
my sword still has weight to it,[NL]
so that's something.[A][LoadOverworldFaces][2NL]
WHAT,[......] my sword.[.....][NL]
It has no weight to it.[A][NL]
What the hell just happened?[A]

[OpenRight][LoadPortrait][0x05][0x01]
What's wrong, Arch?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
My weapon.[NL]
It's weightless.[A][NL]
[OpenFarRight]
What's this weight you speak of?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
How have you never heard of weight?[A][NL]
It's a needed method of adding[NL]
realism and balance.[A][NL]
It's just like how weapons can break.[A]
[OpenRight]
What are you talking about?[A][NL]
Weapons have always been[NL]
weightless and unbreakable.[A][NL]
Arch, you should take another nap.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, I know this is wrong.[A][NL]
I must fix this somehow.[A][NL]
I need to find Kaga to[NL]
fix this nightmare before[A][NL]
the masses begin emulating[NL]
these terrible mechanics...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadPortrait][0x04][0x01]
This guy is crazy.[A]
[OpenRight]
Yeah, but I guess we can't[NL]
just let him go alone.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Ugh, you're right.[NL]
Let's help him out for now.[A][X]
