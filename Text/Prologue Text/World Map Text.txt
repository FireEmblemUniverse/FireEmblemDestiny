In the beginning, Fire Emblem was created.[.6][AN]
Its wacky RNG and difficult gameplay would[N]
bring many moments of laughter and tears,[AN]
and many would overcome its hardships.[AN]
Guided by a God among men known only as[N]
Kaga,[.7] the Emblem of Flame would continue[AN]
to burn until one fateful day when Kaga[N]
disappeared from the face of the realm.[AN]
The poor mortals who were left behind[N]
did all they could to[AN]
keep the Emblem burning, to the point where[N]
they would resort to drastic measures,[A][N]
such as hacking the shit out of[N]
all the GBAFE games,[A][2NL][.6]
And yet, I continue to live, ashamed of it all.[AN]
FEXNA is pretty cool though.[A][X]
