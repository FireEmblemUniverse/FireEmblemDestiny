Ugh, this method of opening a game is[N]
so trash. I bet this is supposed to be[AN]
some bullshit where I reanimate[N]
in the same spot to come "full circle".[A][2NL]
[FastPrint]
Even FE6 has a better opening than this,[NL]
and that's one of the blandest[....] fucking[NL]
games I've ever played.[....] Honestly, the only[NL]
worse way to open a game is to start[NL]
you in a battle, and then say lol,[NL]
it was just a dream.[....] I can't believe[NL]
we've gotten to the point where plot[NL]
is this shit.[....] Only, as hard as it is[NL]
to believe, this shit can get worse[NL]
plot wise. We somehow have more obviously[NL]
evil villains than FE3 Lang, and games[NL]
that are so unbalanced that enemies have[NL]
0% hit rates very early on in the game.[NL]
People somehow think this shit is balanced?[NL]
Lol, what happened to the good ole days[NL]
when companies didn't expect you to[NL]
pay a crapton of money for what is[NL]
obviously an experiment?[.....] What happened[NL]
to people finding a formula that works[NL]
and sticking to it?[.....] What happened[NL]
to having protagonists with actual[NL]
fucking flaws?[.....] Maybe I wouldn't expect[NL]
so much if the first FE released in[NL]
the US wasn't FE7,[....] but damn it we did,[NL]
so why can't IS make something[NL]
that great again?[.....] Why does IS[NL]
feel obligated to fucking cater to[NL]
the lowest possible denominator?[NL]
Their job is to make a good game,[NL]
not a fucking dating sim.[NL]
Yet, here they are, pandering[NL]
straight up to people who shouldn't[NL]
be the target audience of this[NL]
game franchise to begin with,[NL]
and here I am, with nothing to do but[NL]
make fan games that -- [2NL][....][X]
