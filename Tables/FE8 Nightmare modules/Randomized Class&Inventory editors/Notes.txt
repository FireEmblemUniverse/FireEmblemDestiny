These modules deal with some aspects of randomized enemies - both their class and their inventory.

For the "Class Changer" Module, Rando Classes refers to the unit's declared class ID in chapter unit data, before
randomization takes place.

The Random Item Table Editor allows editing the relative probabilities of items showing up in a randomized unit's inventory.
The default probabilities can be found here: http://www.serenesforest.net/fe8/miscellaneous/random-items/monsters/
